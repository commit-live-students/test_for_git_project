# Reshape the above-created zeros_array to dimensions (2,3,4)
Great,now that you have learnt how to create numpy arrays, let's start experimenting by saving the value in a variable named zeros_array_reshaped

## Write a function `array_reshaped_zeros` that :
* Performs the operation of reshaping the variable zeros_array_reshaped to dimensions (2,3,4).

### Parameters:
This function takes in no parameters

### Returns:
| Return | dtype | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| variable zeros_array_reshaped | numpy.ndarray | An array of dimensions (2,3,4)|
