# Numpy Basics

We have already learnt about the basics of Numpy in the in-class session. We have learnt about

* NumPy
    * Creating Arrays
    * Built-in Methods
    * Random Numbers
* Data Manipulation
    * Operators with NumPy
    * Reshaping
    * Arithmetic
    * Aggregation
    * Mathematical Functions

## Why solve this assignment

Let's consolidate our concepts of Numpy as it is an extremely fast and easy-to-use tool for data manipulation. 
Doing this assignment will help you get acquainted with Numpy operations and various frequently used data manipulation
techniques.

## About the dataset 
In the previous assignment, we have worked with the json/yaml data of ball-by-ball delivery of one IPL match.
In this assignment, we provide the ball-by-ball delivery information of a lot of matches in tabular (CSV) format.

So let's get started!
